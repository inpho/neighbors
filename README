This is to develop a web-interface to remotely access the neighbors.py file.
This interface consists of some number of search boxes with associated columns
displaying related terms and their respective similarty to the given search term.
The data presented in these columns is retrieved from a JSON object of the generic form below:
===============================================================================================

{search-term:
	[{related-term_1:similarity_1},
	 {related-term_2:similarity_2},
	 ...,
	 {related-term_n-1:similarity_n-1},
	 {related-term_n:similarity_n},
	]
}

===============================================================================================
Currently, this interface is implemented to run solely on the SEP-BEAGLE lexicon/model used in
the neighbors.py file; however, the ultimate goal is to generalize this interface to run on any
lexicon/model capable of returning a JSON object formatted as described above.
